Car Price Scraping:
Scrape data from multiple sources like car dealerships, online marketplaces, and manufacturer websites. Focus on popular car models to get a wide variety.
Include car make, model, year, price, mileage, condition, and location.

COE (Certificate of Entitlement) Prices:
Different categories of COE pricing: Category A (cars up to 1600cc), Category B (cars above 1600cc), and Category E (open to all cars).
Track COE price trends over time (e.g., weekly/monthly) and use this to predict future costs.

Bank Car Loan Rates:
Scrape data from banks or financial institutions that offer car loans. 
Include loan amount, interest rate, loan tenure, and down payment requirements.
Compare different loan plans across banks.

User Income and Affordability:
Integrate a tool that allows users to input their monthly income, expenses, and savings goals. Then, the system can calculate how long it would take them to afford a car and whether they can realistically afford the car (factoring in COE and loan costs).
Suggest cars based on their income range (e.g., "If you make $X per month, this is the type of car you can afford").

Additional Features:
Loan Repayment Calculator: Create a tool that shows the user how much they would pay monthly based on the loan amount and interest rate.
Price Comparison: Show a list of similar cars with price comparisons, interest rates, and COE costs.

Trend Analysis and Insights:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on car prices, COE prices, and loan rates. Provide insights, such as “Car prices are increasing by X% month-to-month,” or “Loan rates have decreased by Y% in the last year.”
